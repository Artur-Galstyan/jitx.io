# Learning the Transformer

2023-08-21

## Contents

## Introduction

The Transformer is one of the most successful neural network architectures in recent history that powers many of the new AI language models, such as ChatGPT, LLaMA, Claude and others. The transformer architecture was published in 2017 in the now famous Attention Is All You Need paper and in this blog post, we'll take a deep dive into the transformer architecture and try to implement it in Jax (although you can follow along with any other NN library). In this blog post, you will learn about the crux of the transformer: self-attention. So, grab a cup of coffee, pen and paper and let's get started!

You'll probably have to re-read this blog a couple of time to really understand the transformer. In a lot of places, you will see things like "this will be explained later", which can disrupt the flow of reading. Therefore, don't worry if you don't undestand it on the first try. Most people don't. Just keep re-reading until it clicks! ðŸ™ƒ

## Overview

Before we dive into the transformer, it's helpful to start with a high level overview first. In the following figure, you can see the transformer architecture.

<div class="figures">

</div>

The traditional transformer architecture consists of two parts: the encoder and the decoder each of which has a certain role. Let's start with the encoder's role, which you can interpret as the "listener". It takes as input the raw tokens and generates a fixed sized vector. The encoder is typically added in scenarios where the input data first needs to be encoded somehow, before the output tokens are generated. For instance, in translation tasks (such as the original transformer paper), you would get as input the English text "I am happy" and your goal is to translate this into German. Here, you would first pass the text through the encoder and get as output essentially a summary of the input tokens. The decoder would then take that summary as input during its computation. This is what I meant by the encoder being the "listener".

The decoder on the other hand takes the encoder's output (and we will see later exactly what this means) as well as its own output as input. This is what makes the transformer auto regressive: it takes its own output as input and generates new tokens continiously.

As you can see, there are many parts in the transformer, the most important being the Multi-Head Attention block. But we're getting ahead of ourselves. Let's start at the beginning.

## The Input

First, we have our input tokens. In machine learning, everything is a matrix, same with our input tokens. So what are the dimensions of this input matrix? In general, those are

$$
    X = [B \times T \times D]
$$

where $B$ is the batch size, $T$ is the number of tokens and $D$ is the vocabulary size. It can vary, depending on whatever tokeniser you used. If you follow along with Andrej Karparthy's transformer tutorial then $D$ is 65 (since he tokenises on the character level, while sentencepiece or tiktoken tokenise on the token-level, i.e. sub-word level). Let's have a look at some examples.

```python
import tiktoken

enc = tiktoken.get_encoding("gpt2")
encoded = enc.encode("hello, world")

print(f"{encoded=}")
print(f"{enc.n_vocab=}")
encoded=[31373, 11, 995]
enc.n_vocab=50257
decoded = enc.decode(encoded)
print(f"{decoded=}")
decoded='hello, world'

```

in this example, $D$ is 50257. But it makes sense to extend this number to the nearest multiple of 64 for 2 reasons: first, it will make
$D$ divisible by 2, which will be important later and secondly, GPUs like multiples of 64 for efficiency reasons.

So, let's change the code a bit to extend $D$ to the nearest multiple of 64.

```python
def get_next_multiple_of_64(number: int) -> int:
    while number % 64 != 0:
        number += 1
    return number

n_vocab = get_next_multiple_of_64(enc.n_vocab)
```

Next up is the input embeddings, which is a simple embedding layer. You embed the input (which has dimensionality
$D$) into some - preferably smaller - dimension
$d$. Let's have a look at the code.

```python
import equinox as eqx
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
from jaxtyping import PRNGKeyArray, Array, Float

class Transformer(eqx.Module):
    input_embedding: eqx.nn.Embedding

    def __init__(self, n_dims: int, n_embd: int, key: PRNGKeyArray) -> None:
        key, *subkeys = jax.random.split(key, 20) # let's just split 20 for now, we'll probably need them later
        self.input_embedding = eqx.nn.Embedding(n_dims, n_embd, key=subkeys[0])


key = jax.random.PRNGKey(42)
N_EMBD = 4096
transformer = Transformer(n_dims=n_vocab, n_embd=N_EMBD, key=key)
print(f"{transformer.input_embedding.weight.shape=}")
print(f"Number of bits = {transformer.input_embedding.weight.shape[0] * transformer.input_embedding.weight.shape[1] * 32}")
transformer.input_embedding.weight.shape=(50304, 4096)
Number of bits = 6593445888
```

As you can see, our input embedding is quite large. It holds 50304 _ 4096 _ 32 bits worth of information. That's around 824 megabytes, just for the input embedding.

Next up is the positional encoding. This one is a bit tricky since there are many different ways to compute the positional encoding (it can even be learned too). However, it's way more efficient to come up with some strategy which adds positional information to our inputs.

The authors used a sinusoidal positional encoding. But actually, anything goes, as long as you give each token a value that represents its position relative to all the other tokens. LLaMA, for example, uses a different kind of positional encoding, called "Rope Embeddings", but that's a story for another blog post. For now, let's implement the positional encoding:

```python
def get_positional_encoding(n_tokens: int, n_vocab: int) -> Float[Array, "n_tokens n_vocab"]:
    pos = jnp.arange(n_tokens)[:, jnp.newaxis]
    div_term = jnp.exp(jnp.arange(0, n_vocab, 2) * -(jnp.log(10000.0) / n_vocab))
    # alternatively: div_term = 1 / 10000 ** (jnp.arange(0, D, 2) / D)
    # that's closer to the actual notation they used.
    pos_enc = jnp.zeros((n_tokens, n_vocab))
    pos_enc = pos_enc.at[:, 0::2].set(jnp.sin(pos * div_term))
    pos_enc = pos_enc.at[:, 1::2].set(jnp.cos(pos * div_term))
    return pos_enc
```

If you had a lot of GPUs you could even learn the positional encodings directly by simply adding another embedding layer to our transformer. But given how much memory just the input embeddings took, it might not be the most efficient idea. In practice, both approaches yield similar results. And this is also precisely why we wanted to have even numbered dimensions earlier and why we extended
$D$ to the nearest multiple of 64 (making it an even number). We did that, because we want to apply
$\sin$ and
$\cos$ to every second dimension, meaning we needed an even number of dimensions to begin with.

Our input part is almost done. All that's left is to simply compute the positional encodings and add them to the input matrix, before feeding the input to the multi-head attention (MHA) block. We will come back to this part when we actually start training our transformer.

## Multi-Head Attention

Okay, now we get to the most interesting part and to the heart of the transformer. In the earlier figures I had just shown an overview where MHA was just a single box, but there's a lot going on in that box. So let's zoom in a bit.

![Multi-Head Attention](/posts/learning-the-transformer/MHA.drawio.svg)

Before we dive deep into the how and why, let's first identify our trainable parameters. As you can see, there are 4 linear layers: 3 for the query, key and value (whatever those are, we don't know just yet) and another one at the end. Let's implement a first draft and figure out the rest later.

```python
class MultiHeadAttention(eqx.Module):
    query: eqx.nn.Linear
    key: eqx.nn.Linear
    value: eqx.nn.Linear
    output: eqx.nn.Linear
    def __init__(self, *, key: PRNGKeyArray) -> None:
        key, *subkeys = jax.random.split(key, 4)
        self.query = eqx.nn.Linear(key=subkeys[0], use_bias=False)
        self.key = eqx.nn.Linear(key=subkeys[1], use_bias=False)
        self.value = eqx.nn.Linear(key=subkeys[2], use_bias=False)
        self.output = eqx.nn.Linear(key=subkeys[3], use_bias=False)
```

We will come back and fix the above code in just a minute, but at this point it's time for an insertion!

## Insertion: What's the difference between "normal" attention and self attention?

A good question! Attention in machine learning is nothing new and has been used plenty before. However, attention was often calculated in relation to another query, like a question for example. Take a look at the following example:

Query: Doughnuts are tasty! What's the capital of Germany?

A: The capital of Germany is Berlin.

In this example, in the answer the attention of the words capital and Germany are high, as they coincide with the query a lot! In fact, if you think about it, there is little to no need to pay attention to the doughnut part. As you can see, in this example, attention is computed relative to some other query.

In self attention, on the other hand, the attention scores are calculated within the sentence itself!

![Self Attention](/posts/learning-the-transformer/SelfAttention.drawio.svg)

## Multi-Head Attention (again)

Okay, so what's up with these query, key and value vectors? The idea for those comes from recommender systems. Think about YouTube. What you search for is the query, for example: funny cats. YouTube has a huge database of multiple keys such as video title, description etc. Let's say there are only 3 videos in total on YouTube with the following titles:

- cats walking
- horses running
- dogs jumping

Your query is matched against all of these keys to see which one fits best. Let's say, their recommender systems computes these values:

- cats walking - 0.7
- horses running - 0.1
- dogs jumping - 0.2

As you can see, the first video has the highest value. The one with the highest value is the one you care most about, i.e. pay most attention to.

In self attention, we don't have any external keys (otherwise we would have "normal" attention). In our case, the input itself is both query and key! This is what people mean by self attention. The query, key and value vector you saw in the figure above: they're all the same (check circle with the number 1)! The input (after it had the positional encodings added to it) is duplicated 3 times and each copy is named the query, key and value. Let's say the input is the text "How are you". Both query and key contain the phrase "How are you" (in the form of numbers though, but we will get to that). We pass those vectors through the linear layers and then matrix multiply those results. The goal of the query linear layer is to learn what parts of the query tokens each token should pay most attention to (2). The key linear layer learns what tokens are most suitable to answer to the query tokens (2). The matrix multiplication of these matrices yields a score matrix, which holds the self attention information. In our simplified example:

![Self Attention Example](/posts/learning-the-transformer/SASimple.drawio.svg)

The result of the matrix multiplication of query and key can lead to very large numbers, which is why after the multiplication the result is scaled down, which also allows for more stable gradients later. Typically, the results are scaled down relative to the chosen dimensionality. More specifically, the scaling is:

$$
    \frac{\text{scores}}{\sqrt{d_k}},
$$

where $d_k$ is the dimension of the keys.

Note, how there are 3 sizes: D, which is the original input dimension, i.e. the vocabulary size. Then there's d, which is the dimension we chose for the input embedding, i.e. we embed D->d. Then there's d_k, which is d // n_heads, i.e. the embedding dimension divided n_heads times.

When we apply a softmax afterwords, we turn the attention weights into probabilities. At the end, we multiply the attention weights (i.e. query @ key) with the value vector. The idea is that the attention weights highlight the important parts in the value vector and diminish that which we should not pay any attention to.

So far, we have only taked about a single attention head. In a transformer, MHAs have multiple heads (hence the name). This means the input is not split once into query, key and value, but rather
$n_{\text{heads}}$ times (3). Oh no! Another parameter! Quick, let's add that to our implementation!

```python
class MultiHeadAttention(eqx.Module):
    query: eqx.nn.Linear
    key: eqx.nn.Linear
    value: eqx.nn.Linear
    output: eqx.nn.Linear

    def __init__(self, input_dim: int, n_heads: int, key: PRNGKeyArray) -> None:
        key, *subkeys = jax.random.split(key, 4)
        qkv_size = input_dim // n_heads
        self.query = eqx.nn.Linear(
            in_features=input_dim,
            out_features=qkv_size * n_heads,
            key=subkeys[0],
            use_bias=False
        )
        self.key = eqx.nn.Linear(
            in_features=input_dim,
            out_features=qkv_size * n_heads,
            key=subkeys[1],
            use_bias=False
        )
        self.value = eqx.nn.Linear(
            in_features=input_dim,
            out_features=qkv_size * n_heads,
            key=subkeys[2],
            use_bias=False
        )
        self.output = eqx.nn.Linear(
            in_features=input_dim,
            out_features=input_dim,
            key=subkeys[3],
            use_bias=False
        )
```

Uff, quite a lot changed, so let's have a look. We first added the number of heads as a parameter to the init function. But what's up with qkv_size? Well, we need to split the input dimension into the number of heads. (Remember, that the input dimension of the MHA block is not the same as the original dimension, but rather whatever we chose as the embedding dimension for the input embeddings.) That way, each head gets the chance to learn something new for its dimension, independently of the other heads, which are all busy with their respective slice of the input dimension. As you can see, the output layer has the same in and out feature dimension (4). The reason for that is the "concatenate" block you saw earlier, which concatenates all the outputs of the single attention heads into a single matrix, which has the same shape as the original input (which was split n_heads times). So why is there a qkv_size \* n_heads for each of the first 3 linear layers? Think of it this way: alternatively, you could have created a list of those linear layers and iterated each head one at a time. But that's a huge waste of computation! Instead, it's much better to just simply enlarge the linear layers and then - at the end - reshape the matrices to our desired size. We will see that in just a bit.

Alright, let's implement the MHA block (without masking just yet) and walk through all the parts.

```python
class MultiHeadAttention(eqx.Module):
    n_heads: int = eqx.field(static=True)
    qkv_size: int = eqx.field(static=True)

    query: eqx.nn.Linear
    key: eqx.nn.Linear
    value: eqx.nn.Linear

    output: eqx.nn.Linear
    def __init__(self, input_dim: int, n_heads: int, key: PRNGKeyArray) -> None:
        # input_dim will be what we chose for n_embd in the input embedding
        key, *subkeys = jax.random.split(key, 5)
        self.qkv_size = input_dim // n_heads
        self.query = eqx.nn.Linear(
            in_features=input_dim,
            out_features=qkv_size * n_heads,
            key=subkeys[0],
            use_bias=False
        )
        self.key = eqx.nn.Linear(
            in_features=input_dim,
            out_features=qkv_size * n_heads,
            key=subkeys[1],
            use_bias=False
        )
        self.value = eqx.nn.Linear(
            in_features=input_dim,
            out_features=qkv_size * n_heads,
            key=subkeys[2],
            use_bias=False
        )
        self.output = eqx.nn.Linear(
            in_features=input_dim,
            out_features=input_dim,
            key=subkeys[3],
            use_bias=False
        )

        self.n_heads = n_heads

    def _project(self, proj, x):
        seq_length, _ = x.shape
        projection = jax.vmap(proj)(x)
        return projection.reshape(seq_length, self.n_heads, -1)

    def __call__(self, x: Array):
        T, _ = x.shape

        q = self._project(self.query, x)
        k = self._project(self.key, x)
        v = self._project(self.value, x)


        dot_product_vmap = jax.vmap(
            lambda q, k: jnp.dot(q, k.T),
            in_axes=(1, 1),
            out_axes=1
        )
        attention_scores = dot_product_vmap(q, k)
        # TODO: apply masking if needed - we'll get to this later
        attention_scores = attention_scores / jnp.sqrt(self.qkv_size)
        attention_scores = jax.nn.softmax(attention_scores)
        matmul_vmap = jax.vmap(
            lambda s, v: jnp.dot(s, v),
            in_axes=(1, 1),
            out_axes=1
        )

        output = matmul_vmap(attention_scores, v)
        output = output.reshape(T, -1)
        output = jax.vmap(self.output)(output)

        return output
```

Oh, that's quite a lot. Let's break all that down, step-by-step. The first couple of lines are Equinox specific ways to indicate static fields of the module, which are not meant to be trained during backpropagation later. In other libraries, you'll have to check how to specify static fields (in PyTorch, you can just assign those to `self`).

```python
    # this is Equinox specific
    n_heads: int = eqx.field(static=True)
    qkv_size: int = eqx.field(static=True)

```

Then, we have the `__init__` method:

```python
    def __init__(self, input_dim: int, n_heads: int, key: PRNGKeyArray) -> None:
        # input_dim will be what we chose for n_embd in the input embedding
        key, *subkeys = jax.random.split(key, 5)
        self.qkv_size = input_dim // n_heads
        self.query = eqx.nn.Linear(
            in_features=input_dim,
            out_features=qkv_size * n_heads,
            key=subkeys[0],
            use_bias=False
        )
        self.key = eqx.nn.Linear(
            in_features=input_dim,
            out_features=qkv_size * n_heads,
            key=subkeys[1],
            use_bias=False
        )
        self.value = eqx.nn.Linear(
            in_features=input_dim,
            out_features=qkv_size * n_heads,
            key=subkeys[2],
            use_bias=False
        )
        self.output = eqx.nn.Linear(
            in_features=input_dim,
            out_features=input_dim,
            key=subkeys[3],
            use_bias=False
        )

        self.n_heads = n_heads
```

I mentioned earlier that - since we have
$n$ heads - we need to split the input. Currently the input has the shape of
$[T\times d]$, where
$T$ is the number of tokens and
$d$ is the number of dimensions of the input (which - since the input will come after the embedding dimension, will be n_embd). However, after applying the linear layers, we want the query, key and value matrices to have the shape
$[T \times h\times d_k]$, where $h$ is the number of heads and $d_k$
is equal to $D/h$, i.e. the number of dimensions of the input divided by the number of heads. This is another reason why we wanted the dimension of the input embeddings earlier to be the nearest multiple of 64: if we make n_heads equal to a multiple of 32 for example, we are guaranteed an even division for $d_k$.

This reshaping of the output into
$[T\times h\times d_k]$ is what happens in the \_project method:

```python
    def _project(self, proj, x):
        seq_length, _ = x.shape
        projection = jax.vmap(proj)(x)
        return projection.reshape(seq_length, self.n_heads, -1)
```

To be sure you can check it with this:

```python
assert q.shape == (T, self.n_heads, self.qkv_size)
assert k.shape == (T, self.n_heads, self.qkv_size)
assert v.shape == (T, self.n_heads, self.qkv_size)
```

And just to reiterate: $d_k$ is the number of input dimensions divided by the number of heads. $D$ is the original number of dimensions and d is the number of dimensions we wanted to embed the original $D$ dimensions into (i.e. $D\rightarrow d$).

Now that we have the query, key and value, it's time to compute the attention scores:

```python
dot_product_vmap = jax.vmap(
    lambda q, k: jnp.dot(q, k.T),
    in_axes=(1, 1),
    out_axes=1
)
attention_scores = dot_product_vmap(q, k)
```

In the lambda function, we pass the query and key as parameter. Remember, that their shapes is
$T\times h\times d_k$. We want the attention scores to have the shape of
$T\times h\times T$. If you're wondering why, have a look at the following figure.

![Attention Scores](/posts/learning-the-transformer/ThT.drawio.svg)

And that's why we pass as in_axes = (1, 1) because that corresponds to the
$h$ dimension in $T\times h\times d_k$. We specified out_axis = 1 because we want to "place" the dimension we vmap over into axis 1, which means that the output matrix will have the
$h$ dimension on axis 1, which is exactly what we want, since we want the attention score$s$ to have the shape of
$T \times h \times T$. Next up, we apply the scaling and softmax, which is quite simple:

```python
attention_scores = attention_scores / jnp.sqrt(self.qkv_size)
attention_scores = jax.nn.softmax(attention_scores)
```

Now, we need to multiply our scaled, softmaxed scores with the value matrix from the beginning.

```python
matmul_vmap = jax.vmap(
    lambda s, v: jnp.dot(s, v),
    in_axes=(1, 1),
    out_axes=1
)

output = matmul_vmap(attention_scores, v)
```

Let's clarify our shapes again: the attention scores have the shape $T \times h \times T$ and $v$ has the shape of $T \times h \times d_k$. At the end, we want to pass the output through the output linear layer, which expects the shape to be $T \times d$, where $d$ is the number of dimensions of the input (which in turn is the number of output dimensions of the input embeddings). As you can see, the "batch dimension" that we want to vmap over and which is equal for both the scores and $v$ is the axis 1, which is $h$. To be even more specific, this is what happens:

- We dot product $T \times h \times T$ with $T \times h \times d_k$
- By specifying the `in_axis=(1, 1)`, we tell Jax vmap over axis 1; so for now let's plug that axis out (we will place it back in later)
- Now, we're left with these: $T \times T \cdot T \times d_k$ and axis $h$ waiting on the sidelines.
- The resulting matrix has the shape $T \times d_k$
- If we don't specify the `out_axis` explicitly, then Jax would place it to axis 0, which would give us the result $h \times T \times d_k$. But, we want to plug it back in into axis 1, which would make the output matrix have the shape $T \times h \times d_k$ instead, which is what we want.

Reshaping the vector to $T, -1$ makes the first dimension be $T$ and the -1 specifies to multiply the remaining shapes. In our case, the multiplication is $h \cdot d_k$ and if you remember $d_k = d/h$, then you'll notice that we end up with our original input dimensionality $h \cdot d_k = D$:

```python
output = output.reshape(T, -1)
```

Lastly, passing the output through the output layer, gives us a final output matrix with the shape
$T\times d$ And that's it. This was the MHA block for the encoder without masking.

Let's generalise our implementation a bit and add the masking part. But first we need some more background about masking and why we need it.

## Insertion: Masking

In general, the decoder takes the output of the encoder (in an encoder-decoder architecture) and generates data off of it while also using its own previous output as additional input. This makes the decoder autoregressive, i.e. it gets its own output as input. During training, the encoder has access to the entire input sequence and therefore needs no masking (as it's not autoregressive). The decoder on the other hand does need masking. Let's take translation as the task at hand here, where we have an encoder and a decoder. The goal is to translate from English to German. The encoder gets as input sequence "I am happy", processes it and generates a summary vector, which the decoder gets as input. The decoder's goal is to translate that into German _Ich bin glÃ¼cklich_. Let's say the input vector for the decoder is $[SV,START,ICH]$, simplified to $[SV,S,I]$. The current goal is to predict the next word "bin" given the summary vector, the start token and the word "ich". Since the input is $[SV,START,ICH]$, we currently don't even need masking yet, as the goal of masking is to prevent the decoder to have access to future tokens, which are the targets itself. The decoder computes the self-attention for the word "ich" given all the previous tokens:

$$
att('ICH') = \alpha SV + \beta S + \gamma I,
$$

where the greeks are just some weight parameters. In this example the weight $\gamma$ should be high, since that is very important to predict the next word "bin". However, if the training data was instead $[SV,START,ICH,BIN]$, then, when the decoder computes the attention for "ich", it would be

$$
att('ICH') = \alpha SV + \beta S + \gamma I + \eta B
$$

The decoder's goal is to predict "bin", so it shouldn't know about the word "bin". Yet, it computes the attention with Î·â‹…BIN, i.e. the very word it's trying to predict and learn. This is not correct. Therefore, we need to hide the word "bin" from the decoder.

Consider the mask vector $[1,1,1,0]$. If we multiply the mask vector with our weight vector $[Î±,Î²,Î³,Î·]$, then the attention of the word "bin" becomes:

$$

att('ICH')=(1â‹…Î±)SV+(1â‹…Î²)S+(1â‹…Î³)I+(0â‹…Î·)B,


$$

which effectively zeroes out all future, unwanted tokens. Let's now implement masking in our MHA block.

## Multi-Head Attention (again, again)

I alluded earlier to the special mask vector and now, I'll show you how to generate it. Let's look at a smaller example, just so we can visualise everything:

```python
T = 4
tril = jnp.tril(jnp.ones(shape=(T, T)))
print(tril)
mask = jnp.where(tril == 0, jnp.full(shape=(T, T), fill_value=float("-inf")), jnp.zeros(shape=(T,T)))
print(f"{mask}")
mask = jax.nn.softmax(mask, axis=-1)
print(f"{mask}")
```

```
[[1. 0. 0. 0.]
 [1. 1. 0. 0.]
 [1. 1. 1. 0.]
 [1. 1. 1. 1.]]
[[  0. -inf -inf -inf]
 [  0.   0. -inf -inf]
 [  0.   0.   0. -inf]
 [  0.   0.   0.   0.]]
[[1.         0.         0.         0.        ]
 [0.5        0.5        0.         0.        ]
 [0.33333334 0.33333334 0.33333334 0.        ]
 [0.25       0.25       0.25       0.25      ]]
```

In the code, tril is a triangular matrix, with zeroes above its diagonal. With jnp.where, we can generate a
$T\times T$ matrix and change the values to negative infinity, where the tril matrix had zeroes, i.e. `tril == 0`. When we softmax that, we get a nice probability distribution, that sums to 1.

Here's another implementation:

```python
T = 4
mask = jnp.tril(jnp.ones(shape=(T, T))) == 1
print(mask)
logits = jax.random.uniform(shape=(T, T), key=jax.random.PRNGKey(0))
logits = jnp.where(mask, logits, float("-inf"))
print(logits)
logits = jax.nn.softmax(logits, axis=-1)
print(logits)
```

```
[[ True False False False]
 [ True  True False False]
 [ True  True  True False]
 [ True  True  True  True]]
[[0.5338           -inf       -inf       -inf]
 [0.6309322  0.20438278       -inf       -inf]
 [0.21696508 0.32493377 0.7355863        -inf]
 [0.3715024  0.1306243  0.04838264 0.60753703]]
[[1.         0.         0.         0.        ]
 [0.6050494  0.39495057 0.         0.        ]
 [0.26359332 0.29364634 0.44276032 0.        ]
 [0.26482752 0.20813785 0.19170524 0.3353294 ]]
```

In this implementation, we first generate the mask, but this time we make it a boolean mask directly. Then, we say, that the logits are equal to the logits, where the mask is true otherwise it's negative infinity. When we softmax that, we get - once again - a nice probability distribution.

Let's add the second implementation to our code. In fact, I'll just show the entire finished MHA implementation:

```python
class MultiHeadAttention(eqx.Module):
    n_heads: int = eqx.field(static=True)
    qkv_size: int = eqx.field(static=True)

    query: eqx.nn.Linear
    key: eqx.nn.Linear
    value: eqx.nn.Linear

    output: eqx.nn.Linear
    def __init__(self, input_dim: int, dim: int, n_heads: int, key: PRNGKeyArray) -> None:
        key, *subkeys = jax.random.split(key, 5)

        self.qkv_size = input_dim // n_heads


        self.query = eqx.nn.Linear(
            in_features=input_dim,
            out_features=qkv_size * n_heads,
            key=subkeys[0],
            use_bias=False
        )
        self.key = eqx.nn.Linear(
            in_features=input_dim,
            out_features=qkv_size * n_heads,
            key=subkeys[1],
            use_bias=False
        )
        self.value = eqx.nn.Linear(
            in_features=input_dim,
            out_features=qkv_size * n_heads,
            key=subkeys[2],
            use_bias=False
        )
        self.output = eqx.nn.Linear(
            in_features=input_dim,
            out_features=input_dim,
            key=subkeys[3],
            use_bias=False
        )

        self.n_heads = n_heads

    def _project(self, proj, x):
        seq_length, _ = x.shape
        projection = jax.vmap(proj)(x)
        return projection.reshape(seq_length, self.n_heads, -1)

    def __call__(self, x: Array, masking: bool):
        T, _ = x.shape

        q = self._project(self.query, x)
        k = self._project(self.key, x)
        v = self._project(self.value, x)

        assert q.shape == (T, self.n_heads, self.qkv_size)
        assert k.shape == (T, self.n_heads, self.qkv_size)
        assert v.shape == (T, self.n_heads, self.qkv_size)

        dot_product_vmap = jax.vmap(
            lambda q, k: jnp.dot(q, k.T),
            in_axes=(1, 1),
            out_axes=1
        )
        attention_scores = dot_product_vmap(q, k)
        print(f"{attention_scores.shape=}")
        attention_scores = attention_scores / jnp.sqrt(self.qkv_size)
        if masking:
            mask = jnp.tril(jnp.ones(shape=(T, T))) == 1
            mask = jnp.expand_dims(mask, axis=1) # we add an extra dimension at axis 1 for broadcasting
            attention_scores = jnp.where(mask, attention_scores, float("-inf"))
            print(f"{attention_scores}")
        attention_scores = jax.nn.softmax(attention_scores, axis=-1)
        print(f"{attention_scores}")
        matmul_vmap = jax.vmap(
            lambda s, v: jnp.dot(s, v),
            in_axes=(1, 1),
            out_axes=1
        )

        output = matmul_vmap(attention_scores, v)
        print(f"before reshaping {output.shape=}")
        output = output.reshape(T, -1)
        print(f"after reshaping {output.shape=}")
        output = jax.vmap(self.output)(output)

        return output

n_vocab = 128
N_HEADS = 2
T = 4 # 4 tokens
mha = MultiHeadAttention(
    input_dim=n_vocab,
    dim=N_EMBD,
    n_heads=N_HEADS,
    key=jax.random.PRNGKey(21)
)

x = jax.random.uniform(shape=(T, n_vocab), key=jax.random.PRNGKey(11))
output = mha(x, True)
```

And that's it. That's the MHA block with optional masking. Great! Let's add that to our transformer class. You probably forgot about that, right? No worries. Here's the current transformer implementation:

```python
class Transformer(eqx.Module):
    input_embedding: eqx.nn.Embedding

    masked_mha: MultiHeadAttention


    def __init__(self, n_dims: int, n_embd: int, n_heads: int, key: PRNGKeyArray) -> None:
        key, *subkeys = jax.random.split(key, 20) # let's just split 20 for now, we'll probably need them later
        self.input_embedding = eqx.nn.Embedding(n_dims, n_embd, key=subkeys[0])
        dim = n_dims // n_heads
        self.masked_mha = MultiHeadAttention(input_dim=n_dims, dim=dim, n_heads=n_heads, key=subkeys[1])

key = jax.random.PRNGKey(42)
INPUT_DIMS=65
N_EMBD = 4096
N_HEADS = 4
transformer = Transformer(n_dims=n_vocab, n_embd=N_EMBD, n_heads=N_HEADS, key=key)
```

## The Rest

We came quite far and to be honest, most of the hard work is already done with the multi-head attention block. But if we look at the transformer architecture again, we notice a couple of missing things, which are - luckily - very easy to implement. Here it is again for reference:

![Transformer](/posts/learning-the-transformer/Decoder.drawio.svg)

For the remainder of this blog post, we will focus on the decoder only. The other trainable part is the feedforward neural network. That's something anyone can do in their sleep, so let's write it out:

```python
class Transformer(eqx.Module):
    input_embedding: eqx.nn.Embedding
    masked_mha: MultiHeadAttention
    feedforward: eqx.nn.MLP

    def __init__(self, n_dims: int, n_embd: int, n_heads: int, key: PRNGKeyArray, width_size: int=32, depth: int = 2) -> None:
        key, *subkeys = jax.random.split(key, 20) # let's just split 20 for now, we'll probably need them later
        self.input_embedding = eqx.nn.Embedding(
            n_dims,
            n_embd,
            key=subkeys[0]
        )
        dim = n_dims // n_heads
        self.masked_mha = MultiHeadAttention(
            input_dim=n_dims,
            dim=dim,
            n_heads=n_heads,
            key=subkeys[1]
        )
        # Equinox has a built-in MLP module
        self.feedforward = eqx.nn.MLP(
            in_size=n_dims,
            out_size=n_dims,
            width_size=width_size,
            key=subkeys[2],
            depth=depth
        )
```

What's missing now are these add & norm parts. The add part is important, because after applying the MHA to the input, the input is distorted quite a lot. By adding it back, we effectively remind the transformer of how initial structure of the input. As your normalisation: it is required, because our network is quite big and big networks need normalisation in order to train effectively. Here's the RMSNorm implementation which ~stole~ borrowed from the LLaMA2 implementation:

```python
class RMSNorm(eqx.Module):
    weight: Array
    eps: float

    def __init__(self, dim: int, eps: float = 1e-6):
        super().__init__()
        self.eps = eps
        self.weight = jnp.ones(dim)

    def _norm(self, x: Array):
        return x * jax.lax.rsqrt(jnp.mean(x**2, axis=-1, keepdims=True) + self.eps)

    def __call__(self, x: Array) -> Array:
        output = self._norm(x)
        return output * self.weight
```

Let me now show you the full implementation of the (simple) transformer:

```python
class Transformer(eqx.Module):
    input_embedding: eqx.nn.Embedding
    masked_mha: MultiHeadAttention
    feedforward: eqx.nn.MLP
    rms_norm: RMSNorm

    output: eqx.nn.Linear
    positional_encoding: Array

    def __init__(self,
                 n_dims: int,
                 n_embd: int,
                 n_heads: int,
                 key: PRNGKeyArray,
                 width_size: int=32,
                 depth: int = 2,
                 max_token_size: int = 8
                ) -> None:
        key, *subkeys = jax.random.split(key, 20) # let's just split 20 for now, we'll probably need them later

        self.input_embedding = eqx.nn.Embedding(
            n_dims,
            n_embd,
            key=subkeys[0]
        )
        dim = n_dims // n_heads
        self.masked_mha = MultiHeadAttention(
            input_dim=n_dims,
            dim=dim,
            n_heads=n_heads,
            key=subkeys[1]
        )
        # Equinox has a built-in MLP module
        self.feedforward = eqx.nn.MLP(
            in_size=n_dims,
            out_size=n_dims,
            width_size=width_size,
            key=subkeys[2],
            depth=depth
        )
        # Equinox has a built-in MLP module
        self.positional_encoding = get_positional_encoding(max_token_size, n_embd)
        self.rms_norm = RMSNorm(dim=n_embd)
        self.output = eqx.nn.Linear(
            in_features=n_embd,
            out_features=n_dims,
            key=subkeys[4],
            use_bias=False
        )

    def __call__(self, x):
        print(f"side effect")
        x = self.input_embedding(x)
        x += self.positional_encoding
        x = self.rms_norm(self.masked_mha(x, masking=True) + x) # residual connection
        x = self.rms_norm(jax.vmap(self.feedforward)(x) + x) # residual connection
        x = jax.vmap(self.output)(x)
        # x = jax.nn.softmax(x) # we don't softmax here, because we want the raw logits for our loss function
        # but you can totally softmax here and inverse that later;
        return x
```

## Training and Evaluation

Our transformer is done. It lacks a couple of improvements, such as dropout for example. But that's fine. This is more for learning purposes anyway. The following shows a training loop, which uses the TinyShakespeare dataloader, which loads the same tiny Shakespeare dataset that Andrej used in his tutorial. I won't go into detail though, as this is just "regular" engineering and is not specific to the transformer.

```python
from tinyshakespeareloader.hamlet import get_data


data = get_data()


train_dataloader, test_dataloader, vocabulary_size, chars, encode, decode = data["train_dataloader"], data["test_dataloader"], data["vocabulary_size"], data["chars"], data["encode"], data["decode"]
key = jax.random.PRNGKey(420)
INPUT_DIMS: int = int(vocabulary_size)
N_EMBD = 32
N_HEADS = 4
MAX_T = 8

def loss_fn(transformer: Transformer, x: Array, y: Array):
    logits = eqx.filter_vmap(transformer)(x)
    loss = optax.softmax_cross_entropy_with_integer_labels(logits, y)

    return jnp.mean(loss)

def evaluate(transformer: Transformer, test_dataloader):
    loss = 0
    jitted_loss_fn = eqx.filter_jit(loss_fn)
    for x, y in test_dataloader:
        x = jnp.array(x.numpy())
        y = jnp.array(y.numpy())
        loss += jitted_loss_fn(transformer, x, y)

    return loss / len(test_dataloader)

@eqx.filter_jit
def step(
        transformer: PyTree,
        opt_state: optax.OptState,
        optimiser: optax.GradientTransformation,
        x: Array,
        y: Array
    ):
    loss, grads = eqx.filter_value_and_grad(loss_fn)(transformer, x, y)
    updates, opt_state = optimiser.update(grads, opt_state, transformer)
    transformer = eqx.apply_updates(transformer, updates)
    return transformer, opt_state, loss

transformer = Transformer(n_dims=INPUT_DIMS, n_embd=N_EMBD, n_heads=N_HEADS, key=key)
#start_loss = evaluate(transformer, test_dataloader)
#print(f"{start_loss=}")
optimiser = optax.adamw(learning_rate=0.001)
opt_state = optimiser.init(eqx.filter(transformer, eqx.is_inexact_array))
for i, (x, y) in enumerate(train_dataloader):
    x = jnp.array(x.numpy())
    y = jnp.array(y.numpy())
    transformer, opt_state, loss = step(transformer, opt_state, optimiser, x, y)
    if i % 100 == 0:
        eval_loss = evaluate(transformer, test_dataloader)
        print(f"{i}. {loss=}, {eval_loss=}")

print("done.")
print(f"{evaluate(transformer, test_dataloader)=}")
```

If you run this - as is - it won't really be that good. You'll have to scale it up by a lot to see real improvements. Furthermore, we only have a single MHA block. In practice, you would create a sequence of these MHA blocks. Like a multi-layer feedforward network, except where each layer is a MHA block. That is left to the reader as an exercise.

And that's it! That was the transformer. I hope you liked it and will join me again, on my next engineering blog post. Thanks for reading and I will see you in the next one ðŸ‘‹
