    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        Before we dive deep into the REINFORCE algorithm, I <b>highly</b> suggest you first read the <a
            href="/posts/rl-basics">basics of RL</a> before continuing. This post will assume that you have a basic
        understand of the concepts introduced in the basics of RL post. Some parts will be repeated here for
        completeness, but it is highly recommended to read the basics of RL post first.

    <h3>
        The Objective Function
    </h3>
    <p>
        We know that there are two ways to define the return from a <i>trajectory</i>:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            finite horizon undiscounted return
            <Katex math={`R(\\tau) = \\sum_{t=0}^T r_t`} displayMode={true}/>
        </li>
        <li>
            infinite horizon discounted return

            <Katex math={`R(\\tau) = \\sum_{t=0}^\\infty \\gamma^t r_t`} displayMode={true}/>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        And we also know that the probability to <i>"sample"</i> a trajectory depends on the current policy and is
        defined as
        <Katex math={`P(\\tau | \\pi) = p_0(s_0) \\prod_{t=0}^{T-1} P(s_{t + 1} | a_t, s_t) \\pi_\\theta(a_t|s_t)`}
               displayMode={true}/>
        With that in mind, we can define the objective function as the expected return, in other words:

        <Katex math={`J(\\pi_\\theta) = \\underset{\\tau \\sim \\pi_\\theta}{\\mathbb{E}}\\left[R(\\tau)\\right] = \\int_T P(\\tau | \\pi_\\theta) R(\\tau)`}
               displayMode={true}/>
    </p>

    <h3>
        The Policy Gradient
    </h3>
    <p>
        Here's a helpful hint: think of gradients as an <i>operation</i>, like plus or minus. In the case of plus or
        minus, the operation is denoted as
        <Katex math={`+`}/>
        or
        <Katex math={`-`}/>
        but for the gradient, we
        denote that as
        <Katex math={`\\nabla_x`}/>
        , where
        <Katex math={`x`}/>
        is the parameter we want to take the gradient with respect to. In our case, it's
        <Katex math={`\\theta`}/>
        . So, if we take the gradient of the objective function like so:
        <Katex math={`\\nabla_\\theta \\left(J(\\pi_\\theta)\\right)`} displayMode={true}/>
        we get a vector which points in the direction of <i>steepest ascend</i>.
    </p>
    <HintBox
            content={`We actually don't need the paranthesis around J; it's just there to emphasise that the gradient operator
             applies only to the next term. Since there is only a single term, the paranthesis are redundant.`}></HintBox>
    <p>
        Let's understand the gradient a bit better and use a simple example function like
        <Katex math={`f(\\theta) = f(\\theta_0, \\theta_1) = {2\\theta_0}^3 + {3\\theta_1}^4`} displayMode={true}/>

        In RL notation, we usually just write
        <Katex math={`\\pi_\\theta`}/>
        as a shortform for
        <Katex math={`\\pi_{\\theta_0, \\theta_1, \\dots, \\theta_n}`}/>
        where each
        <Katex math={`\\theta_i`}/>
        is a parameter in the model (i.e. the neural network).
    </p>
    <p>
        When we compute the gradient of
        <Katex math={`f`}/>
        with respect to the parameters
        <Katex math={`\\theta`}/>
        , we get a vector as result! You might be wondering why the result is a vector. Think of it this way: for you,
        it should be no problem to compute the derivative of the function
        <Katex math={`f`}/>
        w.r.t.
        <Katex math={`\\theta_0`}/>
        or w.r.t.
        <Katex math={`\\theta_1`}/>
        individually. In fact, the results of both derivates are
        <Katex math={`\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\theta_0} = {6\\theta_0}^2`} displayMode={true}/>
        <Katex math={`\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\theta_1} = {12\\theta_1}^3`} displayMode={true}/>
    </p>
    <p>
        A gradient simply computes <i>all</i> derivates w.r.t. every parameter at the same time. That's why you get a
        vector; it's because the function has multiple parameters and you need a vector that's as long as the number
        of parameters of your function (in our simple example, that would be 2). So, the gradient is:

        <Katex math={`\\nabla_\\theta f = \\begin{bmatrix} 6\\theta_0^2 \\\\ 12\\theta_1^3 \\end{bmatrix}`}
               displayMode={true}/>
    </p>
    <p>
        Now you have a vector which has the same size as the parameters. This gradient points to the direction of
        steepest ascend, which means that if you add this vector to
        <Katex math={`\\theta`}/>
        , then the underlying function
        <Katex math={`f`}/>
        will <i>increase</i>! Similarly, if you subtract the gradient, the underlying function will <i>decrease</i>.
        That's why - in the context of machine learning - people talk about gradient descent. You take the gradient of
        the loss function and subtract it from your parameters, because you want to make the loss smaller. In our case,
        it's reverted because we have an objective function which we want to make as big as possible (because that means
        we got more reward). This also means, that we take the gradient and <i>add</i> it to our parameters as that
        makes
        <Katex math={`J`}/>
        bigger.
    </p>
    <p>
        So back to RL, we want to find the gradient of
        <Katex math={`J`}/>
        so that we can add the gradient vector to our parameters
        <Katex math={`\\theta`}/>
        to get more reward:
        <Katex math={`\\theta_{k+1} = \\theta_k + \\alpha \\nabla_{\\theta} J(\\pi_{\\theta}) |_{\\theta_k}
`} displayMode={true}/>
        Here,
        <Katex math={`\\alpha`}/>
        is the learning rate and
        <Katex math={`\\nabla_{\\theta} J(\\pi_{\\theta}) |_{\\theta_k}`}/>
        refers to the gradient w.r.t.
        <Katex math={`\\theta_k`}/>
        where
        <Katex math={`k`}/>
        is the current iteration. Simply put, take the current parameters, add the gradient on top, and voil√°, you got
        the next set of parameters.
    </p>
    <p>
        Alright, let's get started with the policy gradient. These steps will be a bit more mathematically heavy, so
        buckle up! I'll try to explain each step along the way.

    </p>
    <p>
        Everything up until now should have been very easy. Now we get to one of the more tricky parts. We need to
        perform the so-called <i>log-derivative trick</i>. We do that because computing the gradient of the probability
        directly is
        very complex and also because logs introduce a lot of numerical stability, especially as numbers get smaller.
    </p>
    <p>
        The log-derivative trick is quite simple: the derivative of
        <Katex math={`\\log x`}/>
        is
        <Katex math={`\\frac{1}{x}`}/>
        . So we start with
        <Katex math={`\\log P(\\tau |\\theta)`}/>
        and want to compute the gradient w.r.t.
        <Katex math={`\\theta`}/>
        .

    <p class="text-center">Multiply the probabilities on both sides</p>
    <Katex math={` P(\\tau | \\theta) \\nabla_\\theta \\log P(\\tau |\\theta) = P(\\tau | \\theta) \\frac{1}{P(\\tau|\\theta)} \\nabla_\\theta P(\\tau | \\theta) `}

           displayMode={true}/>
    <p>Alright, now you know about the log-derivative trick. Let's go back to the gradient of the objective function. We
        had just brought in the gradient into the integral.</p>
    <div class="divider">(Reminder) Move Gradient into the Integral</div>
    <p>
        <Katex math={`= \\int_T \\nabla_\\theta \\big(P(\\tau | \\theta)\\big) R(\\tau)`} displayMode={true}/>

    </p>
    <div class="divider">Back To Expectation</div>
    <Katex math={`= \\mathbb{E}_{\\tau \\sim \\pi} \\Big [ \\nabla_\\theta \\log P(\\tau | \\theta) R(\\tau) \\Big ]`}
           displayMode={true}/>
    <p>Now it's time to have a closer look at this term
        <Katex math={`\\nabla_\\theta \\log P(\\tau | \\theta)`}/>
        . First, applying the log, we get

        <Katex math={`\\log P(\\tau|\\theta) = \\log p_0(s_0) + \\sum_{t=0}^{T} \\left( \\log P(s_{t+1}|s_t, a_t) + \\log \\pi_{\\theta}(a_t|s_t) \\right)
`} displayMode={true}/>
        Simple stuff so far: just apply the log to every term in the equation. Next, we apply the gradient operation to
        each term (because the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives). We get:
        <Katex math={`\\nabla_\\theta \\log P(\\tau|\\theta) = \\nabla_\\theta\\log p_0(s_0) + \\sum_{t=0}^{T} \\left( \\nabla_\\theta(\\log P(s_{t+1}|s_t, a_t)) + \\nabla_\\theta( \\log \\pi_{\\theta}(a_t|s_t)) \\right)
`} displayMode={true}/>
        In this equation, each term which has nothing to do with
        <Katex math={`\\theta`}/>
        becomes
        <Katex math={`0`}/>
        . Removing those, we get:
        <Katex math={`\\nabla_\\theta \\log P(\\tau|\\theta) = \\cancel{\\nabla_\\theta\\log p_0(s_0)} + \\sum_{t=0}^{T} \\left( \\cancel{\\nabla_\\theta(\\log P(s_{t+1}|s_t, a_t))} + \\nabla_\\theta( \\log \\pi_{\\theta}(a_t|s_t)) \\right)
`} displayMode={true}/>
        <Katex math={`\\nabla_\\theta \\log P(\\tau|\\theta) =\\sum_{t=0}^{T}  \\nabla_\\theta\\log \\pi_{\\theta}(a_t|s_t)
`} displayMode={true}/>
    </p>
    <div class="divider">(Reminder) Back To Expectation</div>
    <Katex math={`= \\mathbb{E}_{\\tau \\sim \\pi} \\Big [ \\nabla_\\theta \\log P(\\tau | \\theta) R(\\tau) \\Big ]`}
           displayMode={true}/>
    <div class="divider">Replacing
        <p>
            <Katex math={`\\nabla_\\theta \\log P(\\tau|\\theta)`}/>
        </p>

    <Katex math={`\\nabla_{\\theta} J(\\pi_{\\theta}) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\tau \\sim \\pi_{\\theta}} \\left[ \\sum_{t=0}^{T} \\nabla_{\\theta} \\log \\pi_{\\theta}(a_t|s_t) R(\\tau) \\right]
`} displayMode={true}/>
    <p>
        Now that we have this form, and since this is an expectation - we can sample trajectories from our environment
        to estimate the policy gradient. The next question is: how can we actually implement this?
    </p>
    <p>
        Remember, how I mentioned that taking the gradient is like an operation? This means, all we need is to implement
        <Katex math={`\\log \\pi_{\\theta}(a_t|s_t) R(\\tau)`} displayMode={true}/>
        in a Python function and then compute the gradient of that function by using something like <code>grad(objective_function)(params)</code>.
        Conveniently, most neural network frameworks have this functionality built-in. For example, in PyTorch, you can
        simply
        call <code>loss.backward()</code> and it will compute the gradient for you. In Jax, it's even more convenient as
        you can
        simply call <code>jax.grad(objective_function)</code> and it will return the gradient function for you.
    </p>

    <h3>Writing Some Code</h3>
    <p>
        Alright, now it's time to actually write some code. Let's start simply by implementing our policy neural network
        first. In this blog post, I'm using Equinox, which is a neural network library built on top of Jax, but the code
        can easily be translated into any other machine learning framework.
    </p>
    <CodeBox code={`
import equinox as eqx
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
from icecream import ic
from jaxtyping import Array, Float32, PRNGKeyArray, PyTree


class Policy(eqx.Module):
    """Policy network for the policy gradient algorithm in a discrete action space."""

    mlp: eqx.nn.MLP

    def __init__(self, in_size: int, out_size: int, key: PRNGKeyArray) -> None:
        key, *subkeys = jax.random.split(key, 5)
        self.mlp = eqx.nn.MLP(
            in_size=in_size, out_size=out_size, width_size=32, depth=2, key=key
        )

    def __call__(self, x: Float32[Array, "state_dims"]) -> Array:
        """Forward pass of the policy network.
        Args:
            x: The input to the policy network.
        Returns:
            The output of the policy network.
        """
        return self.mlp(x)
`}></CodeBox>
    <p>
        Our policy is just a simple MLP with a ReLU activation function. The input is the state and the output are the
        logits for each action. Next up, the objective function:
    </p>
    <CodeBox code={`
def objective_fn(
    policy: PyTree,
    states: Float32[Array, "n_steps state_dim"],
    actions: Float32[Array, "n_steps"],
    rewards: Float32[Array, "n_steps"],
):
    logits = eqx.filter_vmap(policy)(states)
    log_probs = jax.nn.log_softmax(logits)
    log_probs_actions = jnp.take_along_axis(
        log_probs, jnp.expand_dims(actions, -1), axis=1
    )
    return -jnp.mean(log_probs_actions * rewards)a
    # alternatively:
    # log_probs_actions = tfp.categorical.Categorical(logits=logits).log_prob(actions)
    # return -tf.reduce_mean(log_probs_actions * rewards)
`}></CodeBox>
    <p>
        When we take the gradient of the objective function by calling <code>jax.grad(f)</code>, we will arrive at the
        policy gradient. You might also be wondering why we return the negative mean. When we use optimiser libraries
        such as <code>optax</code>, those libraries expect to perform gradient <i>descent</i> and not gradient ascent.
        The reasoning is, that 99% of the time, you want to minimise the loss function and not maximise it. But in our
        case,
        we actually want to maximise the objective function, so we have to revert the sign to make it a minimisation
        problem.
    </p>
    <p>
        But what we have there is not a real loss function in the traditional sense. There is a beautiful explanation
        on OpenAI's Spinning Up tutorials on this topic:
        <q class="italic">[...] it is common for ML practitioners to interpret a loss function as a useful signal during
            training‚Äî‚Äùif the
            loss goes down, all is well.‚Äù In policy gradients, this intuition is wrong, and you should only care about
            average return. The loss function means nothing.
        </q>
    </p>
    <p>
        Next, we will need a function to sample trajectories from our environment. For this, we will use the
        this function, which performs a single rollout of the environment with discrete actions:
    </p>
    <CodeBox code={`
class RLDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, states, actions, rewards, dones) -> None:
        self.rewards = torch.tensor(rewards)
        self.actions = torch.tensor(actions)
        self.obs = torch.tensor(states)
        self.dones = torch.tensor(dones)

    def __len__(self) -> int:
        return len(self.rewards)

    def __getitem__(
        self, idx
    ) -> tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]:
        return (
            self.obs[idx],
            self.actions[idx],
            self.rewards[idx],
            self.dones[idx],
        )


def rollout_discrete(
    env: gym.Env, action_fn: Callable, action_fn_kwargs: dict, key: PRNGKeyArray
) -> RLDataset:
    obs, _ = env.reset()

    observations = []
    actions = []
    rewards = []
    dones = []

    while True:
        key, subkey = jax.random.split(key)
        observations.append(obs)

        action = np.array(action_fn(obs, **action_fn_kwargs, key=subkey))
        obs, reward, terminated, truncated, _ = env.step(action)
        done = terminated or truncated
        actions.append(action)
        rewards.append(reward)
        dones.append(done)

        if done:
            break

    dataset = RLDataset(
        np.array(observations), np.array(actions), np.array(rewards), np.array(dones)
    )

    return dataset

    )
`}></CodeBox>
    <p>
        The beautiful thing about this function is, that it's completely agnostic to the environment and the function,
        which actually selects the action. The other beautiful thing is - and this is Jax exclusive - is that there are
        implementations of some environment that you can JIT compile, which means you can run the environment on your
        GPU! This is absolutely amazing! Even better, recently, MuJoCo and Brax announced that they will support Jax
        natively, which means you can run those environments on your GPU as well! Now, if that's not cause for
        celebration, I don't know what is!
    </p>
    <p>
        Alright, we have our policy, we have our objective function, and we have a function to sample trajectories from
        our environment. Now, we need to put it all together and train our policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        We'll write a <code>train</code> function like so:

        A quick note on the dataset and dataloader and why we <b>really</b> want to use those. The reason is, that
        in Jax, when you JIT a function you're entering a commitment. You're telling Jax that you want to compile this
        using exactly these specific matrix shapes as input. If you change the shapes, Jax becomes unhappy and will
        recompile the functions with the new shapes in hopes that you won't change them again. But the compilation takes
        time. By using the dataloader, we can ensure that the shapes of the inputs are always the same (especially by
        setting <code>drop_last=True</code>), which means that Jax will only compile the function once and then reuse
        the compiled function for the rest of the training. This is a huge performance boost and is one of the reasons
        why Jax is so fast.

        The step function is standard Equinox/Jax/Optax code:
    </p>
    <CodeBox code={`
@eqx.filter_jit
def step(
    policy: PyTree,
    states: Float32[Array, "n_steps state_dim"],
    actions: Float32[Array, "n_steps"],
    rewards: Float32[Array, "n_steps"],
    optimiser: optax.GradientTransformation,
    optimiser_state: optax.OptState,
):
    # the gradient of the objective function w.r.t. the policy parameters is the policy gradient!
    value, grad = eqx.filter_value_and_grad(objective_fn)(
        policy, states, actions, rewards
    )
    updates, optimiser_state = optimiser.update(grad, optimiser_state, policy)
    policy = eqx.apply_updates(policy, updates)

    return policy, optimiser_state
`}></CodeBox>
    <p>
        The last task is to write a main function and execute it:
    </p>
    <CodeBox code={`
def main():
    env = gymnasium.make("CartPole-v1", max_episode_steps=500)
    key = jax.random.PRNGKey(0)
    policy = Policy(env.observation_space.shape[0], env.action_space.n, key=key)
    optimiser = optax.adamw(learning_rate=3e-4)

    train(policy, env, optimiser)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
`}></CodeBox>
    <p>
        And that's it! You can now run the code and see how the policy learns to balance the pole on the cart. Here's
        the result:
    </p>
    <Figure path="demo.webp"
            caption="The (not final) result of the policy learning to balance the pole on the cart."></Figure>
    <p>
        You can see clear signs of learning, but it's not quite perfect. Take a look at the following reward plot over
        30 epochs.
    </p>
    <Figure path="Figure_1.png" caption="Reward plot over 30 epochs."></Figure>
    <p>
        You can see that the reward is increasing, but it's not quite stable yet. And this is one of the better runs
        too! There is a strange
        phenomenon that I've observed, which is that the rewards will go up and up and then suddenly drop to zero.
        This could be what people refer to as "catastrophic forgetting", because the policy overfits to the environment.
        But strangely enough, my PyTorch implementation doesn't suffer from this problem, even though the networks are
        almost identical.
    </p>
    <p>
        But there you have it. Policy gradients! I hope you enjoyed this post and learned something new. Soon, we will
        explore many other algorithms, such as PPO, DQN, and many more. Stay tuned and I will see you in the next one.
